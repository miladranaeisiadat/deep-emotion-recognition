# deep-emotion-recognition
1D convolutional neural network for speech emotion recognition.<br>
Speech emotion recognition is performed in this project by classifying speech utterances based on their appropriate emotions. Sven different datasets with three different languages are identified as suitable candidates to evaluate a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The data are first processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature extraction method.
